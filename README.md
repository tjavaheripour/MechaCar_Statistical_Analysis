## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

•	In the summary output, each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model. According to our results, vehicle length with a p-value of 2.60e-12 and ground clearance with a p-value of 5.21e-8 provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the MechaCar dataset. In other words, they have a significant impact on MPG.

•	The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

•	we'll evaluate the r-squared value of the model to determine if the model sufficiently predicts our dependent variable(mpg).In this case, the r-squared is 0.7149 which means the model would predict mpg about 72% correctly.
